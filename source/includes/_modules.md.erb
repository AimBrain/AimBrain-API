# Modules

AimBrain supports multiple biometric modalities (modules) as part of its authentication platform. These modules can be used together (e.g. to step-up the authentication on high risk actions) or separately, depending on the specific use-case. Because AimBrain offers a public API, any module can be used in a cross-channel context (e.g. same Voice Module with mobile banking application and customer call center).

## Behavioural

With the behavioural modality AimBrain uses machine learning to track not *what* the user enters, but *how* they enter it.  AimBrain monitors features such as touch pressure, typing speed, as well as movement.
