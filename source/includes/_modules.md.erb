# Modules

AimBrain supports **multiple biometric modalities** (modules) as part of its authentication platform. These modules can be used together (e.g. to **step-up the authentication on high risk actions**) or separately, depending on the specific use-case. Because AimBrain offers a public API, any module can be used in a **cross-channel context** (e.g. same Voice Module with mobile banking application and customer call center).

At the core AimBrain uses advanced **Deep Learning** algorithms based on state of the art, PhD level, scientific research. The technology has **multiple patents granted and pending in UK and US**.

## AimAnomaly

With the AimAnomaly module AimBrain flags abnormalities than could signal fraud, from the large scale right down to the manual onboarding stage. Even if you havenâ€™t pinpointed the data patterns yet, we help you isolate and immobilise fraud, before it gets let in the door.

The technology works in **mobile applications and websites**.

## AimBehaviour

With the behavioural modality AimBrain uses machine learning to track not *what* the user enters, but *how* they enter it.  AimBrain monitors features such as touch pressure, typing speed, as well as movement.

The technology works in **mobile applications and websites**.
