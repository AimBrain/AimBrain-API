## Integration
This section provides an overview of how to integrate AimBrain into production systems as described in the architecture above. For specific SDK integration please view the relevant READMEs.
The integration overview is provided as sequence diagrams below.

In these sequence diagrams interactions between the following components are shown:

* **App** - the app using the AimBrain SDK - developed and maintained by the client
* **SDK** - the AimBrain SDK - developed and maintained by AimBrain
* **Server** - the backend server the **App** communicates to - controlled by the client
* **API** - the AimBrain API - developed and maintained by AimBrain
